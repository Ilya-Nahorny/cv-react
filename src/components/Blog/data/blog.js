      <p class="text-gray-500 mt-6 mb-6 leading-7 dark:text-darkTextChild">
        Web development has come a long way from its early days of static HTML pages. With the advent of JavaScript and CSS, developers were able to create more interactive and dynamic web applications. Today, technologies like React and Vue.js are pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved on the web, enabling developers to build highly responsive and scalable applications.

      <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold dark:text-darkTextMain my-6">The Rise of JavaScript Frameworks</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mt-6 mb-6 leading-7 dark:text-darkTextChild">
        JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js have become integral to modern web development. React, developed by Facebook, is known for its component-based architecture, which allows developers to build reusable UI components. Angular, maintained by Google, offers a full-fledged framework with powerful tools for building complex applications. Vue.js is a progressive framework that provides a balance between ease of use and advanced features.

      <p class="text-gray-500 mt-6 mb-6 leading-7 dark:text-darkTextChild">
        Serverless architectures are gaining popularity as they simplify application deployment and management. Instead of managing servers, developers can focus on writing code while the cloud provider handles the infrastructure. Services like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions offer scalable compute resources on demand, making it easier to build and deploy applications quickly.
